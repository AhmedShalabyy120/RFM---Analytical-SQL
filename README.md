# RFM---Analytical-SQL
using Oracle Sql and window functions to get some insights from the data 
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to segment customers based on their behavior. It involves analyzing a customer's behavior in terms of three key metrics: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.

- Recency: Refers to the time since the customer's last purchase. Customers who have made a purchase more recently are considered more valuable than those who have not made a purchase in a long time.

- Frequency: Refers to the number of purchases made by the customer over a period of time. Customers who make frequent purchases are considered more valuable than those who make only occasional purchases.

- Monetary value: Refers to the total amount of money spent by the customer on purchases over a period of time. Customers who spend more money are considered more valuable than those who spend less.

Using these metrics, RFM analysis creates a score for each customer, with higher scores indicating more valuable customers. This information can be used to create targeted marketing campaigns, offer personalized promotions, and improve customer retention.

For example, customers who have high scores in all three metrics may be given VIP status and offered exclusive discounts or rewards, while customers with low scores may be targeted with promotional offers to encourage them to make more purchases.

RFM analysis is a powerful tool for businesses to understand their customer behavior and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly.
